# dubStubs Code Cleanup Plan

## Notes
- The style.css file currently contains a git diff output instead of plain CSS.
- This causes syntax errors and visual issues in the editor.
- A clean version of style.css is needed, containing only the actual CSS rules.
- index.html should link to the cleaned style.css file for proper styling.
- script.js and index.html also appear to contain git diff output and need to be cleaned up to contain only valid JS and HTML respectively.
- User wants the original HTML comments (index.html, Ticket creator web page, No CSS or JS code here) to remain at the top of index.html.

## Task List
- [x] Extract pure CSS from style.css, removing all git diff markers and headers
- [x] Save the cleaned CSS content to style.css
- [x] Extract pure HTML from index.html, removing all git diff markers and headers
- [x] Save the cleaned HTML content to index.html
- [ ] Extract pure JS from script.js, removing all git diff markers and headers
- [ ] Save the cleaned JS content to script.js
- [ ] Ensure index.html links to style.css and script.js via <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> and <script src="script.js"></script>
- [ ] Verify that the ticket creator page displays correctly with the new files

## Current Goal
Clean up script.js to remove git diff output
